This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in Java programming: the off-by-one error when iterating through arrays. The `Bug.java` file contains code that produces an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` due to incorrect loop bounds. The `BugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code.  The error arises from the use of `<=` in the for loop condition, which attempts to access an element beyond the valid index range of the array.
